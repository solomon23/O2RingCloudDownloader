# O2Ring Auto Downloader & Manager

A simple tool to automatically download your sleep data from Viatom/Wellue servers and prepare it for use in programs like **OSCAR**.

## 🌟 What this tool does
- **Automatic Downloads**: No need to manually export files from your phone or PC app.
- **Smart Merging**: Automatically combines long sleep sessions that the device might have split into multiple files.
- **Note & Label Sync**: Syncs your "Remarks" (notes) and "Stars" (flags) from the Viatom cloud directly into the filenames.
- **OSCAR Ready**: Downloads the raw `.dat` / `.bin` files that OSCAR uses for high-resolution 1-second data.
- **Clean Data**: Automatically ignores very short sessions (like brief tests or accidental starts).
- **HR Spike Analysis**: Automatically analyzes your heart rate data for micro-arousals (spikes) and generates a detailed, interactive HTML report with visually rich charts.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Windows)

### 1. Install `uv` (The Easy Way)
`uv` handles Python and dependencies for you.

#### **Windows**
1. Open **PowerShell**.
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

#### **Linux / macOS**
1. Open your **Terminal**.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

*Close and reopen your terminal to finish the setup.*

### 2. Set Up the Project
The best way to get the project and keep it updated is using **Git**:

1. In your terminal, navigate to where you want the project.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AJolly/O2RingCloudDownloader
   cd O2RingCloudDownloader
   ```
*(If you don't have Git, just download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.)*

3. In your folder, find `o2_config.sample.ini`.
4. Copy (or rename) it to `o2_config.ini`.

### 3. Run the Downloader
Navigate to your folder in PowerShell and run:
```powershell
uv run o2_downloader.py
```
*The first time you run this, it will attempt to find your login details from the official "O2 Insight Pro" PC app. If it finds them, it will save them to your `o2_config.ini` automatically.*

## ⚙️ Configuration (`o2_config.ini`)
Open `o2_config.ini` in Notepad to customize how the tool works:

- **`email` / `password`**: Your Viatom/Wellue account login.
- **`output_dir`**: Where to save the files (default is a folder named `data`).
- **`generate_csv`**: Set to `true` to create files that OSCAR can read.
- **`run_analysis_report`**: Set to `true` to run the HR Spike detector and generate an HTML report.
- **`skip_short_sessions_under_mins`**: Ignores sessions shorter than this (default is 60 minutes).
- **`launch_after`**: (Optional) Put the path to OSCAR here to open it automatically after downloading.
  *Example:* `launch_after = C:\Program Files\OSCAR\OSCAR.exe`

### Command Line Flags
You can override configuration settings using command line flags:
- `--output-dir "path"` : Specify a custom output directory.
- `--csv` / `--no-csv` : Force enable or disable CSV generation.
- `--analyze` / `--no-analyze` : Force enable or disable the HR Spike HTML report generation.

## 📂 Managing Your Data

### The `data` Folder
All your downloaded files go here. 
- **`.bin` / `.dat` files**: These are the raw files you import into **OSCAR**.
- **`.csv` files**: These are optional high-resolution exports for other analysis (Excel, Python, etc.).
- **`detector_results.html`**: A generated summary report of your HR Spikes if the analysis runs.
- **`charts/`**: A subfolder inside `data` containing individual interactive JavaScript charts for every night analyzed.

### Ignoring Sessions
If there's a specific session you never want to see again, you can add its ID or its timestamp (the numbers at the start of the filename) to a file named `ignored_sessions.txt` in the main folder.

### Automatic Merging
If you have a 10-hour sleep that the O2Ring split into three 3-hour files, this tool will detect they belong together and create a single `_merged.csv` file for you.

## 🔄 Download vs. Regenerate Reports

### Download new data from the cloud
```bash
uv run o2_downloader.py
```
This fetches new `.bin`/`.dat` files from Viatom's cloud, converts them to CSV, and runs analysis (if enabled in config). Already-downloaded files are skipped automatically.

### Regenerate HTML reports without re-downloading

**Quick rebuild** (uses cached spike detection results — fast):
```bash
cd analysis && python generate_html_report.py
```

**Full re-analysis** (re-runs spike detection from CSVs):
```bash
cd analysis && python generate_html_report.py --analyze
```

Use the quick rebuild when you want to refresh the HTML after tweaking report templates. Use `--analyze` when you've changed detection parameters or want to reprocess from scratch.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Login failed"**
Double-check your email and password in `o2_config.ini`. If you use the PC app, make sure you've logged in there at least once.

**"No sessions found"**
Ensure your ring has synced with your phone app recently. The data must be in the "Cloud" for this tool to see it.

**"uv is not recognized"**
Make sure you restarted your PowerShell window after installing `uv`.
